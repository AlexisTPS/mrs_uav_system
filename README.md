# Installation

Following options are provided, depending on who you are and what you want to do with the platform.

## I have a fresh Ubuntu 18.04 and want it quick and easy

In this case we provide with installation scripts that set up everything for you.
As the part of the automated installation, we
* install Robot Operating System (ROS),
* install other dependencies such *git*, *gitman*,
* clone [uav_core](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/uav_core), [simulation](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/simulation), [example_ros_packages](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/example_ros_packages) into *~/git*,
* install more dependencies such as *tmux*, *tmuxinator*, *ag*,
* create a ros workspace in ```~/mrs_workspace```,
* link our packages to the workspace,
* compile the workspace,
* added configuration lines into your *~/.bashrc*.

To start the automatic installation, please paste the following code into your terminal and press **enter**.
You might be prompted a few times to confirm something by pressing enter, but most of the choice have an automatic default answer.
```bash
cd /tmp
echo 'mkdir -p ~/git
cd ~/git
sudo apt -y install git
git clone https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_uav_system
cd ~/git/mrs_uav_system
git checkout master
git pull
./install.sh' > clone.sh && source clone.sh
```

## I already have ROS and just want to peek in

If you already have ROS installed and if you are fluent with *workspaces*, *.bashrc*, *catkin tools*, etc., you can clone our repositories individually manually.
The [uav_core](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/uav_core) repository integrates our UAV control system.
Please follow its README for further instructions on how to install its particular dependencies.

The [simulation](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/simulation) repository provides resources for *Gazebo/ROS* simulation, including px4 Simulation-in-the-Loop (SITL), UAV models and useful sensor plugins.
Please follow its README for further instructions on how to install prerequisities.

## I want the nice Linux environment that everybody from MRS works in

Great! In that case you want to install Tomas's Linux-setup.
**Beware!** This might alter you existing configuration of some Linux tools (Vim, Tmux, i3wm, ranger, ...).
Refer to its [README](https://github.com/klaxalk/linux-setup/blob/master/README.md), for more information.
Installation is *not* obligatory and the MRS UAV system will work without it.

Paste following code into your terminal and press **enter**
```bash
cd /tmp
echo "mkdir -p ~/git
cd ~/git
sudo apt -y install git
git clone https://github.com/klaxalk/linux-setup
cd linux-setup
./install.sh" > run.sh && source run.sh
```
